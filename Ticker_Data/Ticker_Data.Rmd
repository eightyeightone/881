library(quantmod)
```



**Data**

Assigning the trading period: year of 2020.

```{r}
time.start <- "2020-01-01"
time.end <- "2020-12-31"

stock.ticker <- "TSLA"
stock.prices <- getSymbols.yahoo(stock.ticker, from=time.start, auto.assign=F)
print(summary(stock.prices))

#stock.open <- stock.prices[,1] # Un-comment as required.
#stock.high <- stock.prices[,2]
#stock.low <- stock.prices[,3]
#stock.close <- stock.prices[,4]
#stock.volume <- stock.prices[,5]
stock.adj_close <- stock.prices[,6]
